# Inline Tab, A Obsidian Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

In Obsidian's editor, key Tab is used to indent a hole paragraph. It's not a comfortable way for some vscode users who are doing frequently such works below.
```markdown
1. @6:20    Arrived
2. @6:45    Kill a bug
3. @7:10    Go on
14. @1225   Got tired...
102. @xxxx  Realy??

Or key pairs:

Apple.......Red
Orange......Orange
My face.....Gray

```
We need this basic inline format in our daily work. It's a simple job in vscode by hitting Tab key. But it's impossible to getting tab key back to us in Obsidian. So I made this plugin to use another hotkey to insert inline tabs.
